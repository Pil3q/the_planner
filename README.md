# The planner
## Requirements
There is a poor little french teacher which happened to my mom and for some reason writes a plan for her students every week while only some of the students are changing. Sending those poor students an emails, text messages, or pigeons to remind them about the classes or exams is currently beyond any hope. Luckily enough I am software developer with a huge need to make this world better. So I am going to help. I believe that failing to prepare is preparing to fail so I will try breakdown what I actually need to do.
